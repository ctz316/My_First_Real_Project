        <h2>Why get certified</h2>
          <p>The average response time for first responders once 911 is called is 8-12 minutes. For each minute defibrillation is delayed, the chance of survival reduces by approximately 10%. Fortunately, with CPR/AED training, which takes just a few short hours, you can gain the skills necessary to help save a life</p>
          <p>Once your training has been successfully completed, you'll receive a two-year certification in CPR/AED, and have the ability to access refresher materials at any time during your certification period.</p>
        <h2>Who Red Cross CPR/AED Training Is For</h2>
          <p>At the Red Cross, CPR/AED training is available for individuals, schools, healthcare providers, businesses and more. And with in-person, online and blended Simulation learning courses, you can choose the type of class that suits your needs best.</p>
        <h2>CPR/AED Renewal & Recertification</h2>
          <p>If you've already been through CPR/AED training from the American Red Cross, but need to renew your certification, you can do so in an abbreviated class designed to refresh your skills and test your knowledge.</p>
