<h1>Things I have accomplished in my own home network</h1>

<p>I have continuously upgraded and improved my home network through things that I have learned through education and experiences. Through this, I have found that my home network resembles more of a corporate mesh network than it does a personal private network.</p>

                <p class="suhs">» I created my own custom length cat 6 cables throughout the house.</p>
                <p class="suhs">» Created a mesh network with multiple Asus routers.</p>
                <p class="suhs">» Created my own custom subnet so that all devices are not on the customary IP addresses.</p>
                <p class="suhs">» Made separate networks that are firewall from each other for each set of devices on my network.</p>
                <p class="suhs">» Hide my SS id.</p>
                <p class="suhs">» Incorporated a stringent VPN for all traffic that goes through my network.</p>
                <p class="suhs">» Enforcing a MAC filtering for all devices on my network.</p>
                <p class="suhs">» Limiting the number of devices allowed all my network.</p>
                <p class="suhs">» Enforcing parental controls for certain devices on my network.</p>

<p>I have enacted each of the security protocols to keep my network and most importantly my family safe.</p>
