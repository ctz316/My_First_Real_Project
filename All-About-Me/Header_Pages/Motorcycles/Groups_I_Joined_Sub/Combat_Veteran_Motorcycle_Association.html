                <br />
                    <p>MY VEST IS FULL OF PATCHES OLD AND NEW,<br></p>
                    <p>REPRESENTING PLACES I’VE BEEN AND THINGS I DO.<br></p>
                        <br />
                    <p>MOST ON THE FRONT AND LAYERED IN STACK<br></p>
                    <p>BUT NONE SAY MORE THAN THE PATCH ON MY BACK.<br></p>
                        <br />
                    <p>I EARNED IT IN BATTLE AS A COMBAT VET,<br></p>
                    <p>IT SERVES AS A CONSTANT REMINDER TO NEVER FORGET.<br></p>
                        <br />
                    <p>THE FIRST THING YOU’LL NOTICE IS THE SKULL AND SPADE,<br></p>
                    <p>A REMINDER THAT THE DEBT OF WAR IS NEVER PAID.<br></p>
                        <br />
                    <p>EVERY COLOR HAS A MEANING AND A STORY TO TELL,<br></p>
                    <p>AND EVERY STORY HAS A MEANING WE KNOW ALL TOO WELL.<br></p>
                        <br />
                    <p>TO SHOW UNITY AS WARRIORS WE USE THE MILITARY GOLD,<br></p>
                    <p>FOR EVERY BRANCH OF SERVICE BOTH NEW AND OLD.<br></p>
                        <br />
                    <p>RED REPRESENTS THE BLOOD THAT MY BROTHERS HAVE BLED,<br></p>
                    <p>NOT ALL KNOWN BY ME, BUT A TEAR FOR EACH I’VE SHED.<br></p>
                        <br />
                    <p>WITH HEAVY HEARTS WE DISPLAY THE SYMBOLIC COLOR BLACK,<br></p>
                    <p>FOR THE MISSING, THE PRISONERS AND THOSE WHO NEVER MADE IT BACK.<br></p>
                        <br />
                    <p>YES, I KNOW IT’S JUST A PATCH – MADE OF CLOTH AND THREAD,<br></p>
                    <p>BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT IT MEANS I’LL RESPECT IT UNTIL THE DAY,<br></p>
                    <p>I’M DEAD!<br></p>

                <p>We are an Association of Combat Veterans from all branches of the United States Armed Forces who ride motorcycles as a hobby. Our mission now is to support and defend those who have defended our country and our freedoms. Our focus is to help veteran care facilities provide a warm meal, clothing, shelter, and guidance, or simply to say "Thank You." and "Welcome Home."</p>
                <p>Our membership comprises Full Members ( those with verified combat service ), Supporter Members (those who have non-combat military service) and Auxiliary members (Spouses of members). We have members from all 50 states and living abroad. Many members continue to serve in our Armed Forces, with several serving in combat areas now.</p>
                <p class="Bold">We sponsor and / or participate in many motorcycle-related charity events each year, and as a non-profit organization donate to various veteran care facilities and veteran charities. The Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association is formed for the betterment of communication and camaraderie between other Motorcycle Associations, Veterans Organizations, and Motorcycle Groups, specifically: </p>
                <ul class="Bold">To promote interest in various forms of motorcycle activity associated with Veterans.</ul>
                <ul class="Bold">To create and maintain camaraderie among Combat Veterans from all U.S. Branches of Service and its allies.</ul>

                <ul class="Bold">To encourage a better understanding of motorcycle riders as a constructive sport among members of the public, press, and law enforcement agencies.</ul>
                <ul class="Bold">We DO have membership fees.</ul>
                <ul class="Bold">We ARE NOT, nor do we claim to be a motorcycle club.</ul>
                <ul class="Bold">We DO NOT have colors.</ul>
