            <h1>What is the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal Decoration?</h1>
                <p>Authorized in September 2002, the U.S. Department of Defense created an award for those who have supported the war on terrorism throughout the nation's war. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal will cease being awarded when the Declaration of National Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks from September 2001 is rescinded by the U.S. government. It is awarded for "support of operations to counter terrorism in a non-deployed status whether stationed in the United States or overseas." Only one such award can be awarded regardless of time served.</p>
                <p>The United States military sorts decorations into categories called Classes and Types. The Global War on Terrorism Service Medal medal is classified as a Service Award of the type General Service Medal.</p>
