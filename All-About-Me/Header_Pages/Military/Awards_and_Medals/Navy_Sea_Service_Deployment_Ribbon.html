            <h1>What is the Navy Sea Service Deployment Ribbon Decoration?</h1>
                <p>The Navy Sea Service Deployment Ribbon was designed to recognize those who have been forward deployed to combat regions and served on an active sea going vessel. It can be earned after serving a minimum of 90-days forward deployed for both the Navy and the Marine Corps. One interesting fact about this ribbon, when a ship's crew qualifies for the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, the ship is authorized to paint and display the ribbon and award stars on the port and starboard side of the bulwark aft of the ship.</p>
                <p>The United States military sorts decorations into categories called Classes and Types. The Navy Sea Service Deployment Ribbon medal is classified as a Service Award of the type General Service Award.</p>
