            <h1>A Brief History of the United States Marine Corps</h1>
                <p>The United States Marine Corps was founded on November 10th, 1775 and have proudly participated in all wars involving the United States of America. Most of the time the Marines are among the first to fight in these battles and have executed more than 300 landings on foreign shores. In addition, the United States Marines have served in every major US Naval action since 1775.</p>
                <p>The Marine Corps itself is technically a separate military service within the Department of the Navy. A fact that any Squid happily reminds any former Jarhead. Banter aside, the Marines offer provision for seizure and defense of advanced bases. Specializing in operation on land and in the air while the Navy controls the sea during campaigns. In addition, The Marines provide detachments for service aboard specific vessels and security for shore installations and foreign missions. During World War II the specialization of the Devil Dogs amphibious landings helped secure islands undertaken by the Japanese. </p>
                <p>The structure of the US Marine Corps is structured with accordance to the National Security Act of 1947. The status of the corps commandment remains coequal with members of the Joint chiefs of Staff in matters pertaining to the corps. The Fleet Marine Force, Pacific (FMFPAC) and the Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic (FMFLANT) are the corps two operating forces. We would like to wish the Marine Corps a Happy Birthday and all those who served a Happy Veterans Day!</p>
