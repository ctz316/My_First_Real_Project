            <h1>A Brief History of the US Army</h1>
                <p>The US Army celebrates its 238th birthday on June 14, 2013. We thought we would share a brief history of the US Army, along with other items of historic and organizational significance.</p>
                <p>The US Army was borne from humble origins—a rag tag group of revolutionaries who sought to protect the freedoms and rights they believed in. They were amateur militiamen, many with no previous military experience. They had little training, no standardized equipment, and no central chain of command. By early 1775, the Revolutionary War was growing and a more formal approach was necessary. Historians have settled upon June 14, 1775 as the official birthday of the US Army. This was the date the Second Continental Congress formed a committee to draft rules and regulations to support an army comprised of members of the colonies. They also committed to providing funds and training. The Second Continental Congress appointed George Washington as the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, and he took command on July 3, 1775.</p>
                <p>From those humble beginnings rose the world’s most powerful, best-equipped, and best-trained army. As you can imagine, these changes didn’t happen overnight. It has taken over 200 years of war and peace for the US Army to evolve into its current state as an organization, and the world’s most elite army.</p>
