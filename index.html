    <h1>This is has been my journey leading upto a new career into the IT world.</h1>

<p>Hello. And, thank you for taking a deep dive into the life of your next great employee. I have set this website up for you to gain an understanding of who I am while at the same time showcasing the skills that I have learned so far. Through this website, you will find that I have gained a wide variety of skills and experiences from my time in the military and in the civilian world that that shaped me into a person that values family, team building, project accomplishment, constant improvement, and integrity.</p>

<p>I have always valued family. Throughout my life, I have seen firsthand that having a great family has a huge impact on someone’s life. I have not appreciated the difference that this had on my life, until I met people that were not so fortunate. I have vowed to myself as a single father with sole custody, to ensuring that my daughter is given the same support that I have always received. This may not seem like a great benefit to a company, but, it is. This is because it has shown me how to be a supporter of other people. </p>

<p>  Team building is essential for any successful enterprise. Unfortunately, I feel that team building has become an overused term for people that do not truly understand what it means. Most people use this term to mean that they accomplish their task while encouraging their teammates to accomplish their own goals. This is actually not the case. Team building means being able to adapt and make it easier for the goal to be accomplished for each person in the team while making sure that every person in the team feels that they contributed and proud of accomplishing the goal. In the “Work History” tab I will explain how I accomplish this at each job. I attribute this trait as being one of my largest contributors to my success in life and on the job.</p>

<p> I am very much goal oriented. I love accomplishing goals and creating Successful results for the teams that I am a part of. Nothing in this life is achieved without a team. I have been a part of teams that have created results above and beyond anything that was believed possible. These results were only achieved by being able to foster the pride people felt and being a part of a team.</p>

<p> There is no better feeling Then seeing a project accomplished. Throughout this website, you will find large projects that I have been a part of, that are Some of my greatest professional achievements. Some achievements are derived of being the leader and some are derived from being a member of some amazing teams.</p>

<p> I truly believe the only constant in this universe is change. Because of that, I am continuously seeking to involve into a better version of myself. Some of this I have accomplished through formal education and some through life experiences. Being able to adapt, learn and change is the way for a person to become better than they were. In these following pages you will see how I have been able to do this in my own life. </p>

<p> Integrity is another term that I believe people use and have not truly embraced the meaning. In several jobs I have been the interviewer and asked the question “What does integrity mean?”. Some were able to give me a coherent answer, but, very few were able to provide me an example of them showing integrity in their own life. Unfortunately, I feel that people do not truly understand that integrity can be large or small actions that they have taken in their life. While returning the $1 million you found on the road to its rightful owner does show integrity, so does returning an empty wallet that you found in the parking lot. </p>

<p> Summarized, I have given a very brief descriptions of values I believe make a great employee. Throughout this website I will continuously show examples of my personal values and how they make me a great employee. </p>
